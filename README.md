# EQ-3 Radiator valve control application for ESP-32

![tested on ESP-WROOM-32](https://img.shields.io/badge/tested--on-ESP--WROM--32-brightgreen.svg)

EQ-3 radiator valves work really well for a home-automation heating system. They are fully configurable vie BLE as well as their front-panel. There are more options available than the calorBT app makes available.

The main problem with centrally controlling them is the limited range of BLE. This makes it impossible to use a single central-controller to talk to all TRVs in a typical house. Therefore multiple 'hubs' are required at distributed locations.

## Description

This application acts as a hub and uses BLE to communicate with EQ-3 TRVs and makes configuration possible via MQTT over WiFi. 

When using calorBT some very basic security is employed. This security however lives in the calorBT application and not in the valve. The EQ-3 valves do not require any authentication from the BLE client to obey commands.

### Configuration

On first use the ESP32 will start in access-point mode appearing as 'HeatingController'. Connect to this AP (password is 'password' or unset) and browse to the device IP address (192.168.4.1). The device configuration arameters can be set here:  

| Parameter | Description | Exampels |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ssid | the AP to connect to for normal operation | |
| password | the password for the AP | |
| mqtturl | url to access the mqtt broker<br>allowed values:<br><br>- IP-Address, Hostname or Domainname only ("mqtt://" is used in this case)<br>- URL with scheme mqtt, ws, wss, tco, ssl (only mqtt is tested yet)| 192.168.0.2<br>mqtt://192.168.0.2<br>ws://192.168.0.2 |
| mqttuser | mqtt broker username | |
| mqttpass | mqtt broker password | |
| mqttid | the unique id for this device to use with the mqtt broker __(max 20 characters)__ | livingroom |
| ip | fixed IP for WiFi network (leave blank to DHCP) | |
| gw | gateway IP for WiFi network (leave blank for DHCP) | |
| netmask | netmask for WiFi network (leave blank for DHCP) | |

#### Reset configuration

The application can be forced into config mode by pressing and holding the `BOOT` key AFTER the `EN` key has been released.

### Determine EQ-3 addresses

Once connected in WiFi STA mode this application first scans for EQ-3 valves and publishes their addresses and rssi to the MQTT broker.  
A scan can be initiated at any time by publishing to the `/<mqttid>radin/scan` topic.  
Scan results are published to `/<mqttid>radout/devlist` in json format.

Control of valves is carried out by publishing to the `/<mqttid>radin/trv` topic with a payload consisting of:
  `ab:cd:ef:gh:ij:kl <command> [parm]`
where the device is indicated by its bluetooth address (MAC)

### Supported commands

| Parameter | Description | Paramters | Exampels | Stable since |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| settime | sets the current time on the valve | settime has an additional parameter of the hexadecimal encoded current time.<br>parm is 12 characters hexadecimal yymmddhhMMss (e.g. 13010c0c0a00 is 2019/Jan/12 12:00.00) | *`/<mqttid>radin/trv <eq-3-address> settemp 13010c0c0a00`*<br><br>`/livingroomradin/trv ab:cd:ef:gh:ij:kl settemp 13010c0c0a00` | v1.20 |
| boost | sets the boost mode | -none - | *`/<mqttid>radin/trv <eq-3-address> boost`*<br><br>`/livingroomradin/trv ab:cd:ef:gh:ij:kl boost` | v1.20 |
| unboost | reset to unboost mode | -none - | *`/<mqttid>radin/trv <eq-3-address> unboost`*<br><br>`/livingroomradin/trv ab:cd:ef:gh:ij:kl unboost` | v1.20 |
| lock | locks the front-panel controls | -none - | *`/<mqttid>radin/trv <eq-3-address> lock`*<br><br>`/livingroomradin/trv ab:cd:ef:gh:ij:kl lock` | v1.20 |
| unlock | release the lock for the front-panel controls | -none - | *`/<mqttid>radin/trv <eq-3-address> unlock`*<br><br>`/livingroomradin/trv ab:cd:ef:gh:ij:kl unlock` | v1.20 |
| auto | enables the internal temperature/time program | -none - | *`/<mqttid>radin/trv <eq-3-address> auto`*<br><br>`/livingroomradin/trv ab:cd:ef:gh:ij:kl auto` | v1.20 |
| manual | disables the internal temperature/time program | -none - | *`/<mqttid>radin/trv <eq-3-address> manual`*<br><br>`/livingroomradin/trv ab:cd:ef:gh:ij:kl manual` | v1.20 |
| offset | sets the room-temperature offset | the temperature to set, this can be -3.5 - +3.5 in 0.5 degree increments | *`/<mqttid>radin/trv <eq-3-address> offset 3.5`*<br><br>`/livingroomradin/trv ab:cd:ef:gh:ij:kl offset 3.5` | v1.20 |
| settemp | sets the required temperature for the valve to open/close at | the temperature to set, this can be 5.0 to 29.5 in 0.5 degree increments| *`/<mqttid>radin/trv <eq-3-address> offset 20.0`*<br><br>`/livingroomradin/trv ab:cd:ef:gh:ij:kl settemp 20.0` | v1.20 |

In response to every successful command a status message is published to `/<mqttid>radout/status` containing json-encoded details of address, temperature set point, valve open percentage, mode, boost state, lock state and battery state. 

This can be used as an acknowledgement of a successful command to remote mqtt clients.

### JSON-Format of status topic

| Key | Description | Exampls | Since Version |
| ------------- |  ------------- |  ------------- |  ------------- |
| trv | Bluetooth-Address of the corroesponding thermostat | `"trv":"ab:cd:ef:gh:ij:kl"` | 1.20 |
| temp | the current target room-temperature is set | `"temp":"20.0"` | 1.20 |
| offsetTemp | the current offset temperature is set | `"offsetTemp":"0.0"` | 1.30 (upstream merge in dev) |
| mode | the current thermostate programm mode<br><br>`"auto"` = internal temperature/time program is used<br>`"eco"` = internal temperature/time program is used and eco mode is currently active<br>`"manual"` = internal temperature/time program is disabled | `"mode":"auto"`<br> `"mode":"eco"`<br> `"mode":"manual"` | 1.20 |
| boost | boost-mode is active / inactiv | `"boost"`:`"active"`<br>`"boost"`:`"inactive"` | 1.20 |
| state | front-panel controls are locked / unlocked | `"state"`:`"locked"`<br>`"state"`:`"unlocked"` | 1.20 |
| battery | battery state | `"battery"`:`"GOOD"`<br>`"battery"`:`"LOW"` | 1.20 |

### Read current status

There is no specific command to poll the status of the valve but using any of the commands to re-set the current value will achieve the required result.

Note: It has been observed that using unboost to poll a valve can result in the valve opening as if in boost mode but without reporting boost mode active on the display or status. 
It is probably not advisable to poll the valve with the unboost command.

### MQTT Topics

| Key | Description | published | subscriped |
| ------------- |  ------------- |  :-------------: |  :-------------: |
| `/<mqttid>radout/devlist` | list of avalibile bluetooth devices | X | |
| `/<mqttid>radout/status ` | show a status message each time a trv is contacted | X | |
| `/<mqttid>radin/trv <command> [param]` | sends a command to the trv | | X |
| `/<mqttid>radin/scan` | scan for avalibile bluetooth devices | | X |

## Usage Summary

On first boot this application uses Kolbans bootwifi code to create the wifi AP.  
Once configuration is complete and on subsequent boots the configured details are used for connection. If connection fails the application reverts to AP mode where the web interface is used to reconfigure.

mosquitto_sub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1883 -t "<mqttid>radout/status"  # will show a status message each time a trv is contacted  
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 1883 -t "<mqttid>radin/trv" -m "ab:cd:ef:gh:ij:kl settemp 20.0" # Sets trv temp to 20 degrees
```
